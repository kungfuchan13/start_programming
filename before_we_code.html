Now that you're all excited to make interesting and creative projects with programming, you probably want to hop right in and start coding. Before that, though, we should first take a look at what exactly it means to program, and what <i>you</i> will get out of programming.<br>
<br>
Essentially, a computer program acts like a cooking recipe for your computer. Like a cooking recipe, a program needs ingredients (inputs), instructions on what to do with those ingredients, and it should result in something useful for the end user. The difficulty in creating a computer program is that one often begins with the desired result (say, a video game) and has to work backwards to figure out what ingredients and steps are required to generate that result. Since that can be overwhelming to think of with large projects, it is crucial to be able to break down a problem into smaller pieces that can then be worked on individually and fit together to create the whole product.<br>
<br>
To illustrate, say you wanted to make an apple pie. You would probably separate the task between creating the pie crust and filling, and then even further steps like mixing and shaping the dough. Eventually, you reach a point where the ingredients required for each step match the ingredients you have, and you can then begin making your pie.<br>
<br>
Leaving out the names of the steps, it may look something like this:<br>
<br>
<div class="pie"><br>Apple Pie<br>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pie">
<- Pie Crust<br>
<br>
<- Filling
</div>
<div class="pie">
<- Dough<br>
<br>
<- Apples, Cinnamon, etc.
</div>
<div class="pie">
<- Flour, Shortening, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="clear: left;">
<br>
Naturally, this diagram skips over many of the important details required to actually make a pie, but the general idea is that you need to break down the process until it becomes something you can work on with the tools and ingredients you have.</div><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, then. What is <i>your</i> motivation to start programming? In general, they can be broken into two categories: learning programming to achieve some specific purpose, like working in computer security, or learning programming for the sake of acquiring the skill. Regardless of your motivation, it is important to ensure that what you learn in programming stays relevant to you. At every point possible while studying, you should think about how the concepts you are learning can be applied to your own interests. For example, if you enjoy crocheting and are just learning to put text on the screen, perhaps you could write a program that displays a crocheting pattern. In this way, you can keep your studying programming interesting and relevant as you build up the skills and knowledge necessary to create larger programs.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this sort of association can be very difficult when learning programming. After all, many of the components of programming are incredibly elementary and must be combined several times before something interesting can be done. In some ways, this is like being given a frying pan and being told to make "something" with it. It is certainly possible to do a lot with a frying pan, but figuring out what to make and determining what ingredients are needed to create them can be difficult. Once you have a few recipes (programs) under your belt, though, you can build off them, and this process becomes easier.<br>
