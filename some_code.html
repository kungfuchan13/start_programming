Yep, we're finally gonna start coding a bit now. For the purposes of learning, the Python programming language is quite nice. It is fairly easy to read, and it has tools that allow for easy experimentation. Moreover, it has all the power needed for most typical applications, so, for the most part, no matter what sorts of projects you come up with, Python should be able to handle them.<br>
<br>
With that said, you can download Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.<br>

Okay. Now that you have the latest version of Python installed, we can talk about how you can use it. First off, you should look for something in your python folder called IDLE and open it. Use the search function on your computer if you don't know where it is.<br>
<br>
This should open up a text editor-like thing that looks kinda like this:<br>

<br>
You can type some stuff there and see what happens. Particularly interesting are numbers and things between quotation marks. Those things do not make IDLE spit out a <font color="red">threatening block of red text</font>, which is good. You can also do things like add and subtract and multiply and divide using the +, -, *, and / operators.<br>
<br>
Okay, so you probably want to do more with Python than just use IDLE as a calculator. You can create a New File using the Ctrl+N or Cmd+N command (or from the File menu), from where you can actually start writing a standalone program.
