So, you want to learn to program.<br>
<br>
That's all well and good, but before we even think about coding or programming languages or anything of that sort, we should discuss what programming is about, in the first place.<br>
<br>
For some, they may think programming is about code and algorithms. Their definition of a programmer is someone who is able to read and create arcane blocks of text that look something like this:<br>
<br>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
<code>
var counter = document.getElementById("counter");<br>
<br>
var count = 0;<br>
function incrementCounter() {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; counter.value = count++;<br>
}
</code>
</div>
<br>
Of course, the ability to read and create code is necessary to be a programmer, but attributing that one trait to the entirety of programming is like saying that the only skill a painter needs is the ability to put paint on a canvas. Depending on one's definition of art, it could be argued that that would be the case, but clearly, far more goes into the typical painting than just randomly splattering paint across a canvas. This distinction lies in the creative, artistic aspect of painting, as a form of expression.<br>
<br>
In the same way, programming is a creative process. The ability to read and write code is necessary to express oneself using this medium, just as knowing how to understand and construct sentences is necessary to be a writer. The code programmers write is not simply an arcane block of text that lives in some bubble, but rather akin to the notes a composer writes on a sheet of music to create a pleasing melody.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the above example again. If that block of code was not the point, what <i>was</i> the point, then?<br>
<br>
<input id="counter" type="button" style="width: 200px; height: 100px; background-color: #a0a; font-size: 24pt;" value="Click Me!" onclick="incrementCounter();"><br>
<br>
Well, here we go.<br>
<br>
It counts up from 0. Isn't that nice? That menacing block of code is simply the way that idea of making a cute little counter like this is translated to something the computer understands how to do. In summary, programming is the process of turning one's visions into reality, using the computer as the medium and code as the tool of the trade.<br>
